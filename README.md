# Regional-Sales-Analysis
## Overview
The Regional Sales Analysis Dashboard is a business intelligence project aimed at visualizing sales data across various regions and product categories.

## Problem Statement
Businesses often generate vast amounts of sales data but lack the tools to effectively analyze and extract meaningful insights from it. This leads to missed opportunities, inefficient strategies, and poor decision-making. The challenge lies in presenting complex data in a way that is both accessible and actionable.  
This project addresses that gap by building an interactive Power BI dashboard that allows users to monitor regional sales performance, identify trends, compare product categories, and track key sales metrics in a single, consolidated view.
